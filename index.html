									Reflections on Creating Augmented and Virtual Reality Applications: Current Practices, Challenges, and Opportunities
									by Narges Ashtari, Andrea Bunt, Joanna McGrenere, Michael Nebeling, Parmit K. Chilana (2020)		
								</h5>
								<br>
								<p>
									This paper highlights the challenges that non-professional creators are facing when working on AR/VR projects, and I was instantly interested by this, because as a postgraduate student I have to complete a VR project and maybe there are some potential challenges I will face too.
								</p>
								<p>
									To begin with I must say that I am impressed, that despite a vast amount of AR/VR applications, studies and commercial use scenarios have emerged in the span of many years, there are so many barriers for an end-user developer to understand the AR/VR landscape. And I can’t help but wonder why this is the case. Maybe it has to do with the fact that AR/VR isn’t yet completely endorsed by the market, and as a result there aren’t many candidates to invest in educating a big part of the workforce in this field. Additionally some of the companies who have adopted these technologies, may have more specific development patterns or frameworks fitting to their needs that cannot be implemented by creators outside of this company.
								</p>
								<p>
									Also while this is the case, there may not be so much trial and error to know which practices are better. For example the paper notes that there is a lack of concrete design guidelines and examples, and how can someone create those guidelines, if an AR/VR product hasn’t been tested in a wide amount of everyday users to find out what a good UX is? Although there is a great difference in user testing with the 2D applications, which is a step that most of the non-professionals skip, according to the paper, because of the unfamiliarity of many users with these technologies, as well as the natural difficulties that arise when the creator cannot see what the users sees in the HMD on a VR application for example.
								</p>
								<p>
									Another factor is that AR/VR is a quickly developing sector in terms of its technology, because it is a field that is strongly connected by its nature with the available hardware, so every next generation, a developer needs to keep up-to-date with the evolutions. This can be a struggle even for an expert developer in this field, let alone the end-user developers. As a result companies don’t give long term support for their products and creators need to figure out what to do with outdated manuals, tutorials or instructions.
								</p>
								<p>
									At the end, I must say that I look forward to seeing which of these struggles we will encounter on a VR experience we have to build for a class project, and figure out if I can relate with the AR/VR creators that participated in this study.

									Reflections on At the Heart of It All: The Concept of Presence
									by Lombard, M., & Ditton, T. (2006).
								</h5>
								<br>
								<p>This paper gives, in my opinion, a unique interpretation for presence describing it as the illusion of nonmediation. I believe that this perspective of presence is a really good way to define it, as it can give in such an abstract term such as presence, a way to intercept it in a more tangible way. And this can be done not only for the scientist that tries to measure it, but also for the everyday person that experiences the feeling of presence. Although I find it somewhat difficult to measure presence in this way, because let's say if someone has a person to always keep track of how invisible to them is the medium, then doesn’t the medium automatically become less invisible, like telling someone to try not to think of something and they think of it?</p>
								<p>I also found quite interesting the concept of social realism versus conceptual realism. I believe that while both contribute to the feeling of presence there could be many scenarios where both of them could be low, but the feeling of perceived presence still be high, like for example in a surreal animation movie where neither the scenario is true to life nor the object or the protagonist are photorealistic</p>
								<p>Additionally, I feel that the presence as a medium as a social actor is something that the paper describes really well considering it was written many years before. It directly made me think of technologies such as generative AI and chatbots, and how much these mediums as social actors can give a person the feeling of presence. </p>
								<p>At last I like how the paper raises some interesting and important questions about the feeling of presence considering its psychological impact on a person, as it seems that people have some deeper psychological reasons that make us desiring the feeling of presence and trying to find it in a lot of situations, even if the cues are really primitive, but why does this happen? And considering that there will always be ways to improve the perception of presence, how far can it go?</p>

									Reflections on Enhancing Our Lives with Immersive Virtual Reality 
									by Slater, M., & Sanchez-Vives, M. V. (2016). 
									Frontiers in Robotics and AI, 3(April 2017)
								</h5>
								<br>
								<p>The authors of this paper do a really good work in covering a wide spectrum of applications where Virtual Reality could be helpful, and they manage to do it in a thought provoking way. I like the fact that the paper is not focused so much on the technical aspects but instead combines the findings of several other papers to go deeper and give a more holistic approach to the matter.</p>
								<p>First of all, I find quite interesting the authors point of view on VR as given comprehensively enough in the simple phrase “VR is reality that is virtual”, which was really groundbreaking for me as I always mistakenly thought of VR as a fake reality. Additionally I agree with the authors opinion that the real key in VR is that it can go beyond our reality.</p>
								<p>Also the section of Immersion and Presence made me reflect on how VR can “take advantage” of the way our perception works to give someone the sense of an authentic experience, based on the fact that perception is a back and forth process, in the sense that it combines bottom-up and top-down processing. So the person who has a VR experience, as I see it, can respond to enough sensory inputs so that its brain can effectively construct the missing pieces and perceive this as reality, and this as I understood it is the basis of how immersion works.</p>
								<p>Continuing, the part of the virtual body made the biggest impression on me, as it seems that there are many facts that emerge concerning the connection between the person that goes through a virtual experience with its virtual body. One of these is the fact that we can relatively easily adapt in using a different body than ours in VR, as shown by the experiment with the lobster where humans learn to control the “feet” on the abdominal region, and also how participants learn to use their tail to avoid harm. This in my opinion opens the way to an extreme variety of experiences that can be really mind blowing and exciting to have, but it can also help to a good extent people who are uncomfortable with their physical bodies or want to self-identify differently.</p>
								<p>It's also really interesting that someone can choose a virtual body to create something from the perspective of a different group of people. Furthermore I must say that I didn’t expect for the virtual body to have such a strong psychological impact on the person that embodies it. For example the fact that participants whose avatar face was more attractive moved closer to other avatars, or that having a dark-skinned body lead participants to a more expressive movement. This fact is two-sided in my opinion, because from one side it can give a greater sense of equality in the virtual world, but on the other side this sense of equality is based on the stereotypes that can be transferred to the virtual world. For example, someone may choose a taller avatar because it makes them feel better in relation to other avatars, but this sense may be derived from a stereotype against shorter people. 
									And this leads us to the fact that social interactions in VR could be really affected by the choice of the avatar. I believe that this can have some helpful applications also, as someone choosing a different virtual representation than their real characteristics, can see the word from the lens of another social group, and likely they can develop an empathy for this group and interact with it in a healthier way.
									</p>
								<p>There are many other domains that the paper describes where VR could have a potential benefit and improve our lives but I will go directly through the end where the authors make some remarkable comments about the concept of presence and immersion, and this really helped me to better realize these concepts. For example the remark that if someone doesn’t know or get to a point to forget that they are living a VR experience then the presence is basically lost cause the sense of being there is now a fact for them, and as weird as it sounds someone in this state might actually feel presence when getting out of this VR experience. So it really made me reflect on the matter of how much immersion can be improved in VR. Is VR capable of reaching the immersion levels of reality? Can it surpass it? Because in the end the level of immersion in reality is fixed but in VR it may always be improved.

									Reflections on “Would You Give a Virtual Electric Shock to an Avatar?” By Mar Gonzalez-Franco, Mel Slater on April 12, 2019
								</h5>
								<br>
								<p>This is a study inspired from the famous Milgram’s experiment but adapted in the field of VR. This is a really interesting version of this famous experiment but also conducted in an ethical way. </p>
								<p>A question that arose to me firstly after reading the paper is how can someone measure the obedience in this experiment, because I believe it is a gray area knowing if you are measuring the obedience or let’s say the empathy or the physiological tolerance of a person. </p>
								<p>But nevertheless I got impressed with the outcome of this experiment that the participants essentially disobeyed when trying to obey by giving hints to the avatars. I believe the most interesting thing here, and the essence of this experiment for me, is that humans can form a connection with things that are not conscious. Maybe it was the actors' voices that influenced their connection a little bit, but the main point is that in the end they risked their obedience to authority by trying to help a human-like object created by graphics in a virtual space.  And I think this says a lot about human nature and the empathy people are able to feel, not for just other people, but essentially for everything that they can connect with. </p>
